## Js client

(client.ts file)
The client you can run by typing "run" in the terminal.
This will create a new account if it does not yet exist and then chop a tree and print out the wood and energy value of the player.

```js
let gameDataAccount = await pg.program.account.playerData
  .fetch(playerDataPda)
  .catch(async (error) => {
    // Check if the account is already initialized, other wise initialize it
    let txHash = await pg.program.methods
      .initPlayer()
      .accounts({
        player: playerDataPda,
        signer: pg.wallet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
      })
      .signers([pg.wallet.keypair])
      .rpc();

    console.log(`New player created.`);
    console.log(`Use 'solana confirm -v ${txHash}' to see the logs`);
    await pg.connection.confirmTransaction(txHash);
  });
```

Then we pre calculate how much energy the player would currently have in the client so that we don't need to call update all the time. This will save us some RPC calls and puts a bit more logic in the client:

```js
let playerAccout = await pg.program.account.playerData.fetch(playerDataPda);

const TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY = 30;
const MAX_ENERGY = 5;

// You can calculate how much energy the player currently has in the client without calling the program.
// Like this you can also show a nice countdown to the player until he gets the next energy.
let clientEnergy = playerAccout.energy;
let lastLoginTime = playerAccout.lastLogin * 1000;
let timePassed = (Date.now() - lastLoginTime) / 1000;
while (timePassed > TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY && clientEnergy < MAX_ENERGY) {
  clientEnergy = +clientEnergy + 1;
  playerAccout.lastLogin = playerAccout.lastLogin + TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY;
  timePassed -= TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY;
}
```

Finally we chop a tree, which will decrease the energy by one and give the player one wood:

```js
let txHash = await pg.program.methods
  .chopTree()
  .accounts({
    player: playerDataPda,
    signer: pg.wallet.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([pg.wallet.keypair])
  .rpc({ skipPreflight: true });

console.log(`Chopped tree`);
console.log(`Use 'solana confirm -v ${txHash}' to see the logs`);
await pg.connection.confirmTransaction(txHash);

playerAccout = await pg.program.account.playerData.fetch(playerDataPda);
lastLoginTime = playerAccout.lastLogin * 1000;
timePassed = (Date.now() - lastLoginTime) / 1000;
let timeLeftUntilEnergy = 60 - timePassed;

console.log(
  `After chop you have now ` +
    playerAccout.wood +
    " wood and " +
    playerAccout.energy +
    " energy left. Next energy in: " +
    timeLeftUntilEnergy.toFixed(2) +
    " seconds."
);
```

This will be the output when you run the game:

```js
$ run
Running client...
  client.ts:
    New player created.
    Use 'solana confirm -v H5YJZhLQna3VmirPKKB9c42uQDYb11FicPVfPNSpoJmBvXen4Vhn6Phmz1t7P6G4AFR6oTAynif95ggUVc6gaCS' to see the logs
    You currently have 0 wood and 5 energy in the client calculated and 5 in the on chain account.
    Chopped tree
    Use 'solana confirm -v 242ZwBj4HAhgC1dC3Bi4sirDDWQFM6JcAf3R8mhou8mdWb6gLcJa1e3Ko6i9kxJkSW1ay6Ftp51ahmUmZHr2BrXM' to see the logs
    After chop you have now 1 wood and 4 energy left. Next energy in: 57.26 seconds.

$ run

    After chop you have now 2 wood and 3 energy left. Next energy in: 48.66 seconds.
```

With this you can now build any energy based game and even if someone builds a bot for the game the most he can do is play optimally, which maybe even easier to achieve when playing normally depending on the logic of your game.

This game becomes even better when combined with the [Token Example](https://solanacookbook.com/gaming/energy-system.html#calculating-the-energy) cook book and actually drop some spl token to the players.

Here is a complete example based on the Solana dapp scaffold:
