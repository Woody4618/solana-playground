1) In the terminal below type "build" to the project 
2) Connect your wallet on the bottom left 
3) Save your key phrase 
4) Get some sol: "solana airdrop 1" (If you get this error: 
Process error: Client error: "Too many requests for a specific RPC call, contact your app developer or support@rpcpool.com."
then pick another RPC Endpoint on the bottom left the little gear symbol. devnet_achemy works well for me)
5) Run "solana airdrop 1" until you have 5 sol 
6) "solana balance" should now show your balance of 5 Sol
7) Type "deploy" This will now deploy your game to dev net. This will take a while
8) Write "run" this will initialize the level1 account and start runing to right.
8) Write "run"
8) "run" again
9) Type "solana address", copy your address and paste it into the solana explorer at https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
10) Enjoy looking at the logs from the transactions and see your little character starting his journey. 
11) You can also replace walkRight with walkLeft in the client to walk back to the start.
12) Think of what else you could do with this and let me know if you can come up with some game ideas.
