4) Get some SOL: `solana airdrop 2` (If you get this error: 
Process error: Client error: "Too many requests for a specific RPC call, contact your app developer or support@rpcpool.com."
then pick another RPC Endpoint on the bottom left the little gear symbol. `devnet-alchemy` works well for me).
5) Run `solana airdrop 2` until you have 6 SOL.
6) You can see your balance with `solana balance`. You can also see your balance in the bottom bar.
7) Type `deploy` This will now deploy your game to devnet. This will take a while.
8) Write `run` this will initialize the level1 account and start runing to right.

8) `run` again.
9) Type `solana address`, copy your address and paste it into the solana explorer at https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
10) Enjoy looking at the logs from the transactions and see your little character starting his journey.
11) You can also replace `walkRight` with `walkLeft` in the client to walk back to the start.
12) Think of what else you could do with this and let me know if you can come up with some game ideas.
