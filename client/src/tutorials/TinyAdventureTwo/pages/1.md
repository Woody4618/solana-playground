# Rewarding players with sol! üìù

Hey!

Please follow the instruction for the setup in the Tiny Advenure tutorial for the basics if you have not yet.

In this Tutorial we will learn how we can deposit sol in a chest and reward it to a player.

For that we will use a second PDA called chest vault.
